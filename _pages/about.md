Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Christopher.

I build forest mapping technologies that provide insights into how the world's ecosystems are changing and how we, as people, change with them. From space.

I'm the Science Lead for Forest Ecosystems at [Planet](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/), a premier satellite earth observations company. Previously I was co-founder and CTO of [Salo Sciences](https://salo.ai), a conservation technology company acquired by Planet, where I designed and built the [Forest Observatory](https://www.forestobservatory.com).

I also maintain an affiliation at the [Center for Conservation Biology](https://ccb.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, where I completed my PhD. in the Department of Biology. Throughout my 20's I worked at the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science, flying across forests around the world with the [Global (n√©e Carnegie) Airborne Observatory](https://gdcs.asu.edu/programs/global-airborne-observatory).

All of the above came after I experienced a traumatic brain injury that nearly took my life when I was 21. Since then I've lived like I'm on borrowed time, deciding to spend it trying to make the world a more just, sustainable, and wonderful place, mostly by mapping and communicating how the earth is changing and making the information as actionable and accessible as possible.

This website is a portfolio of the work I've done in support of these goals. I've focused on integrating images, words & numbers, working to provide insights that are informative, intuitive, and beautiful.

You can read more about the scientific publications I've led or co-authored in the [Research](/project/research) section. The [Design](/project/design) section features digital artwork and scientific figures I've created. You can learn more about the open source [Software](/project/software) I've developed for earth science, and browse a collection of featured [Photography](/project/photography) from my travels to forests around the world.

Thanks for reading.

Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Chris.

I build forest mapping systems to reveal how the world’s ecosystems are changing from space. I'm particularly interested in revealing how we, as people, are changing with them.

I'm the Lead Scientist of the Forest Ecosystems team at [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/products/planetary-variables/), a satellite company. Previously, I was co-founder and CTO of [Salo Sciences](https://salo.ai), a conservation technology company, where I designed and built the [Forest Observatory](https://www.forestobservatory.com).

I completed my PhD. at Stanford University at the [Center for Conservation Biology](https://ccb.stanford.edu), and throughout my 20’s I worked at the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science, flying across forests around the world with the [Carnegie Airborne Observatory](https://globalfutures.asu.edu/gdcs/global-airborne-observatory/).

These all followed a severe head injury that nearly took my life at 21. Since then I've been living on borrowed time, working trying to make the world a more just, sustainable, and wonderful place. I mostly do this by mapping and communicating how the earth is changing, and making the information as accessible and actionable as possible. This is an ongoing effort.

This website is a portfolio of the work I've done to this end, where I've focused on integrating images, words & numbers, working to provide insights that are informative, intuitive, and beautiful.

You can read more about the scientific publications I've led or co-authored in the [Research](/project/research) section. The [Design](/project/design) section features digital artwork and scientific figures I've created. You can learn more about the open source [Software](/project/software) I've developed for earth science. Browse a collection of featured [Photography](/project/photography) from my travels to forests around the world. Read about how this work has been received in the [Media](/project/media) section.

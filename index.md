## About me

I'm about the earth. 

I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Salo](https://salo.ai), a conservation analytics & monitoring company, and a PhD student at Stanford University in the [Center for Conservation Biology](https://ccb.stanford.edu). I map biodiversity and climate change with satellites, which is pretty neat.

## Science

I've spent my career as a research ecologist. My skills include processing, analyzing & visualizing ecologial data, which I've used to help understand the evolutionary, environmental & spatial drivers of species diversity and carbon storage. We're building Salo to further develop these themes by applying novel technological approaches for mapping biodiversity to large-scale conservation and restoration efforts. We're seeing tons of opportunities to use global ecological data and science to better manage ecosystems worldwide, which I think is also pretty neat. 

Below is a list of the peer-reviewed scientific publications I've contributed to as an author. You can access my full cv [here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf?raw=true).

## Software

I lead development of the `salo` python package as CTO at Salo, which will soon be available as an open source library. I've lead one other public-facing software project, *ccb-id*, and I maintain a personal python library.

- [ccb-id](https://github.com/stanford-ccb/ccb-id) - a tree species mapping package for imaging spectroscopy data, which was developed for this [data science competition](https://peerj.com/articles/5843/). It ranked first in predictive accuracy among all participants, outperforming methods developed by researcher groups from five other universities.
- [aei-py](https://github.com/christobal54/aei-py) - my personal python package repository. nothin' special.

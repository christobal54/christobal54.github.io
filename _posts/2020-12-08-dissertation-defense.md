I defended my dissertation last week and now I'm an earth doctor. Hooray!

In this work, I sought to further develop the technical and conceptual basis for building global biodiversity monitoring systems using satellite earth observations data.

I owe so, so much to my adviser, Gretchen Daily, and to my committe members: Erin Mordecai, Chris Field, Rodolfo Dirzo & Alberto Diaz-Cayeros. I learned so much from them, and I am deeply grateful for their support.

It is a tremendous privilege to be part of the Stanford community, and I am grateful for the opportunity I had to grow and learn as part of it. I'll continue to work with the [Center for Conservation Biology](https://ccb.stanford.edu) and the [Natural Capital Project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/) in the future, and I look forward to continue developing tools to help us track how our planet's biodiversity is changing in response to climate change, land use change & population growth.

You can find links to the chapters I've already published in the [research](/project/research) section, and I'll be sure to upload the full dissertation as soon as it's approved by the University Registrar.

### Live recording

[Here's a link to my defense](https://stanford.zoom.us/rec/play/XQ-JRYtEOu1TWIMki-HNWAGCrnnt4m_AxOtO4SUdiXXGQRJmvK6A0dGeXv0KX7x1Md9Zhorwl0rSBqOA.fiPN2JZhCvZ4zadt?continueMode=true). Gretchen introduces me for the first ~5 minutes and I dig in from there. I hope you enjoy it!

I'll embed the video on this site as soon as a youtube link becomes available. For now, enjoy a placeholder with one of my favorite songs.
